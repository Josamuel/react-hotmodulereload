# react-hot_module_reload

tutorial of how hot module reload works with webpack in react. 

To get this running, all you need to do is 

type npm install 
and then npm start. 

After you've successfully started the server, navigate to 

locahost:8080 

to see the incrementer working and feel free to change the text rendered in the App component to whatever you desire.  After you save the app component file, you should see whatever changes you made render on the screen, no page refreshing required : D : D
